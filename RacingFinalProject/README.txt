README

Our master branch has a lot of old work in it... We worked through the night Thursday in a direction that got us no where. We even tried to find some examples with some code that we could use as a guide for us but couldn't get that to work.

We then backtracked, by now it was about 4:30 am, to where we had been before we made this detour. We were in a state of delirium and doing everything we could to get a project that somewhat resembled a game.

--- We finally got it to a semi-working place. This "new" code, which is actually our original code before detouring can be found in the 'old' branch of our 'GabeJacob' repository.

 You can see that we had many commits/pushes to our master repository until realizing that we were better off about 5 hours prior. Ben asked us to make a README to help explain this. There are still bugs that we wanted to fix but didn't find the time. Thank you for reading through this! (:
